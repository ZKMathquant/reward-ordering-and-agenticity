This project uses standard, widely accepted reinforcement learning benchmarks:

- FrozenLake-v1 (Gymnasium)
- Taxi-v3 (Gymnasium)

These environments are canonical MDPs used in:
- Sutton & Barto
- OpenAI baselines
- Numerous theoretical RL papers

They are NOT synthetic data created for this project.
They are fixed, externally defined benchmarks.
